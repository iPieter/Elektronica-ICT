	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<h2>Pieter</h2>	 
	<p>On a dark night, a single pedestrian ploughed throught a layer of snow, almost 3 inches thick, fallen on the parking lot in front of the local hospital. She was searching for her car, amongst all the cars covered by a blanket of snow. All the lights behind the windows on the cubical, concrete building on the background had been switched off hours ago. <i>Not that I expected something else, on this hour,</i> she thought. On the very moment she finished removing the 3 inch-tick layer of snow, she heard a piercing scream coming from the same building behind her; she heard the same sound she expected people make just before they die.</p>

<p><i>Someone could die,</i> she realized. When she drove away from the building, more specifically the maternity ward, she failed to realize no man died that night, however a child was born. A boy. </p>

<p>Years went by, and the blond-haired woman had forgotten the piercing scream on that parking lot, but her unconscious memories kept preserving the emotions she associated with that very scream, waiting to surface until she heard a similar sound. In her daily life, there was a ubiquitous flood of cries, but nothing like the sound that echoed through the aisles of a hospital in North Brabant. The cries of children were not similar at al; children make cries of joy, not sorrow. Even the whining toddler on the playground sounded </p>
